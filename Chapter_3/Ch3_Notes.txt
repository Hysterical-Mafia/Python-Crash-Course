Chapter 3 : Introducing Lists

What Is a List?

    - Square Brackets [] indicate a list and individual elements in the list are seperated by commas
    - A collection of items in a particular order
    - If asked to print, Python returns the list including square brackets

        Accessing Elements in a List:
            - Lists are ordered collection, 0-X, to pull a specific element in a list, write the list name, followed by the index of the item in square brackets, 
                ex. bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
                print(bicycles[0]) will print ['trek']
		
        Index Positions Start at 0, Not 1: 
            - The first item in a list is considered to be at position 0 in most programming languages
            - To access the last element in a list, you can ask for the item at index '-1', this continues on with -2,-3 and so on

        Using Individual Values from a List:
            - Can use f-strings to create a message based on a value from a list
		Ex. 'message = f"My first bicycle was a {bicycles[0],title()}."'
			This would return the sentence followed by the type of bicycle that takes index 0 on the list, it titlecases it then fixes it in the sentence
            -
