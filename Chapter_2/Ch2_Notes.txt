Variables:

  Naming and Using Variables:
        - Variables can only contain letter numbers and underscores
        - Cannot start with a number but can start with an underscore
        - Spaces not allows in variable names
        - Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variables
        - Variable names should be short but descriptive  (name_length is better than length_of_persons_name)  
        - Be careful using lowercase L and uppcase O, can be mistaken for 1(one) and 0(zero)
        - For now, variables should be lowercase, uppercase letters in variable names tend to have special meaning which will be discussed later

    Avoiding Name Errors When Using Variables:
        - Tracebacks are records of where the interpreter ran into trouble when running the code

    Variables Are Labels:
        - Think of variables as labels you can assign to values

Strings:

  Changing Case in a String with Methods:
    - A "method" is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data, for example .title() is a method, the dot(.) tells Python to make the title() method act on the variable name
    - Every method is followed by a set of parentheses because methods tend to need additional information for their work which is provided in the parentheses
    - The title method makes every word start with a capital letter
    - The upper() and lower() change the string to all uppercase or all lowercase
    - The lower() method tends to be useful for storing data, since you dont have to worry about what capitilization the user has used

  Using Variables in Strings:
    - Formatted string(f-string) are strings that Python formats by replacing the name of any existing variable in braces with its value

  Adding Whitespace to Strings with Tabs or Newlines:
    - To add a tab to your text you can use "\t"
    - To move to a new line you can use "\n"

  Stripping Whitespace:
    - .strip(), .lstrip(), .rstip() can be used to get rid of whitespace that is not wanted

  Removing Prefixes:
    - .removeprefix(' ') can be used to remove a prefix, inside the parenthesis you want to enter the prefix you want to remove from the string

Numbers:

    Integers:
      - Python supports the order of operations
      - Spacing has no effect on how Python evaluates the expressions

    Floats:
      - A Float is any number with a decimal point

    Integers & Floats:
      - Dividing any two numbers will result in a float always
      - Mixing a float and an integer in any other operation also results in a float
      - Python defaults to a float in any operation that uses a float

    Underscores in Numbers:
      - You can use _ in long numbers to make it more readable, python ignores these underscores ex. 1000 is the same as 1_000 which is the same a 10_00

    Multiple Assignment: 
      - You can assign a value to multiple variables at once using just a single line of code ex. x,y,z = 0,0,0

    Constants:
      - A constant is a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life of the program
      -  Python does not have built in constant types, you can use all capital letters to indicate that a variable should be treated as a constant and never changed

Things to Keep in Mind:

  - .title() changes each word to title case, where each word will start with a capital letter
  - .upper() changes each word to uppercases
  - .lower() changes each word to lowercases
  - \t can be used to add a tab to your text
  - \n can be used to create a new line
  - \n\t tells Python to move to a new line and start that new line with a tab
  - .strip() strips all of the whitespace in a string
  - .rstrip() strips whitespace from the right side of  a string
  - .lstrip() strips whitespace from the left side of a string
  - .removeprefix() can be used to remove a prefix from a string

  - VARIABLE = 12 written in all caps lets the program know the variable should be treated as a constant
