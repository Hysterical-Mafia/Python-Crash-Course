The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than ccnplex.
Ccnplex is better than canplicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of anbiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right*
If the implanentation is hard to explain, it â€¢s a bad idea.
If the impl&entation is easy to explain, it may be a wod idea.
Nanespaces are one honking great idea let's do nore of those!
