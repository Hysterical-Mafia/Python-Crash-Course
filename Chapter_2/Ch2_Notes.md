**Chapter 2 : Python Crash Course**

**Variables:**

   ** Naming and Using Variables:**
        -Variables can only contain letter numbers and underscores
        -Cannot start with a number but can start with an underscore
        -Spaces not allows in variable names
        -Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variables
        -Variable names should be short but descriptive  (name_length is better than length_of_persons_name)  
        -Be careful using lowercase L and uppcase O, can be mistaken for 1(one) and 0(zero)
        -For now, variables should be lowercase, uppercase letters in variable names tend to have special meaning which will be discussed later

    **Avoiding Name Errors When Using Variables:**
        -Tracebacks are records of where the interpreter ran into trouble when running the code

    **Variables Are Labels:**
        -Think of variables as labels you can assign to values
